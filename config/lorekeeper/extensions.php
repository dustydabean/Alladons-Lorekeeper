    | This enables/disables a selection of extensions which provide QoL and are
    | broadly applicable, but perhaps not universally, and which are contained
    | in scope enough to be readily opt-in.
    |
    | Extensions with a single value for their setting are enabled/disabled via it
    | and have no additional configuration necessary here. 0 = disabled, 1 = enabled.
    | All of the extensions here are disabled by default.
    |
    | Please refer to the readme for more information on each of these extensions.
